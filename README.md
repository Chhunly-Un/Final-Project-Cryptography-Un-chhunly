# Final-Project-Cryptography

# Project's name: CryptoGuard
# Introduction
 
CryptoGuard is a desktop application that allows users to encrypt and decrypt data, generate key, create secure hash, and analyz their password. On that time on this project just a demo GUI by using python.
The primary goal of my project is to provide a real-world demostration of how cryptographic algorithms and principle can be applied dto secure data. My CryptoGuard is a bridge the gap between theoretical crytography and practical cybersecurity inplementation.
# Application Features
# 1/ Cryptography
It mean include such as encryption and decryption (file or text) and adding more if possible.
# 2/ Thread Analysis
Analyz like weaak password detection, weak key size detection, and hash collision risk checking


# Note: IN THIS PROJECT WILL HAVE SOMETHINGS CHAGE IF POSSIBLE!
