# Final-Project-Cryptography
# Project Name: CryptoGuard

## CryptoGuard

CryptoGuard is a secure encryption application that uses **hybrid cryptography**
(RSA-3072 and AES-256-GCM) combined with **digital signatures** to protect text and files.
The project demonstrates how modern cryptographic techniques can be used to ensure
confidentiality, integrity, and authentication in a user-friendly application.
